> Chrome extension for unlocking overseas access to NetEase Music (New Version)

## Introduction

This is a Chrome extension that helps overseas users access NetEase Music. This project is an optimization based on the previous two versions, updated to meet Chrome's latest extension requirements.

As the original authors are no longer maintaining their versions, and I personally need to use NetEase Music overseas, I've updated this extension to help more overseas users.

- Version 2: [nondanee/NetEaseMusicWorldPlus](https://github.com/nondanee/NetEaseMusicWorldPlus)

## Major Updates

1. Adopting Chrome Extension Manifest V3
   - Compliant with Chrome's latest extension specifications
   - No more extension disabled warnings
   - Better performance and security

2. Optimized Implementation
   - Using declarativeNetRequest instead of traditional request interception
   - Simplified to single mode for intuitive operation
   - No system hosts file modification needed

1. After installation, click the extension icon in the toolbar to toggle enable/disable
2. Grey icon indicates disabled status
